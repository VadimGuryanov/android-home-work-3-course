    <string name="description">The Librarian is a novel that won the Russian Booker Prize and sparked scandals and debates in society; a novel about sacred texts - but without the “book dust” of Borges and Eco: books are used here for their direct archetypal purpose - set in metal, they crush weak skullcaps, break fates, call to the fire and invade the fabric of the universe.</string>
